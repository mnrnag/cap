<h1>Information about planets</h1>

<h3>Mercury ;</h3>
<p>Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system, is the smallest and closest to the Sun. It's a rocky planet with a thin exosphere and a heavily cratered surface similar to Earth's Moon. Its orbit is also the fastest, completing a year (orbit around the Sun) in just 88 Earth days.  </p>

<h3>Venus ;</h3>
<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "twin" due to its similar size and mass. It's a terrestrial planet with a solid, rocky surface and an iron core. Venus is also known as the hottest planet in our solar system, experiencing temperatures hot enough to melt lead. </p>

<h3>Earth</h3>
<p>Earth is our home planet, the third one from the Sun in our solar system, and it's also known as the "blue planet" due to its vast oceans. It's a unique world, being the only one known to harbor life and possessing liquid water on its surface. Earth is a rocky planet, made up of layers including the crust, mantle, and core. </p>

<h3>Mars</h3>
<p>Mars, often called the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. It's a cold, desert-like world, smaller than Earth and with a thin atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and exhibits seasons, polar ice caps, and volcanoes, including the largest in our solar system, Olympus Mons. </p>

<h3>Jupiter</h3>
<p>Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system, is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It's twice as massive as all other planets combined and has a diameter eleven times that of Earth. Jupiter also boasts a system of rings, a famous Great Red Spot, and 92 known moons, including four large ones called the Galilean moons. </p>

<h3>Saturn</h3>
<p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is a gas giant known for its iconic ring system. It's the second-largest planet in the solar system, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is also the only planet with an average density less than water. </p>

<h3>Uranus</h3>
<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, a gas giant and ice giant characterized by its unique sideways tilt and blue-green color. It's the third-largest planet in our solar system, four times wider than Earth. Uranus is known for its very cold and windy atmosphere, and it has 28 known moons, including the five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. </p>

<h3>Neptune</h3>
<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system, and is considered an ice giant. It's a gas giant with a deep blue color, and has a rocky core surrounded by a mix of water, ammonia, and methane ices. Neptune is 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth. </p>
